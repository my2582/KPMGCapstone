       "b'\\nOctober 20, 2014\\n\\nCenters for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services\\n\\nDepartment of Health and Human Services\\n\\nAttention: CMS-9940-P\\n\\nP.O. Box 8010\\n\\nBaltimore, MD 21244-1850\\n\\nRE: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the\\n\\nAffordable Care Act.\\n\\nIn a notice published in the Federal Register on August 27, 2014 (Vol. 79, No. 166, pp. 51118\\xe2\\x80\\x93\\n\\n51127), the Departments of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Labor, and the Treasury issued\\n\\nproposed rules related to a section of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) that\\n\\nrequires group health plans and health insurance issuers in the group and individual markets to\\n\\nprovide benefits, without cost-sharing, for a series of preventive services, notably including\\n\\ncontraceptive services. On behalf of the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit organization dedicated to\\n\\nadvancing sexual and reproductive health worldwide through research, policy analysis and public\\n\\neducation, I am pleased to submit the following comments on the proposed rules.\\n\\nUnder Sec. 2713 of the Public Health Service Act, as established by the ACA, individuals with\\n\\nprivate health coverage (aside from those in grandfathered plans) have the legal right to coverage of a\\n\\nspecified list of preventive health services without cost-sharing. That list includes the full range of\\n\\ncontraceptive methods, services and counseling for women. Contraception was included in that list\\n\\non the recommendation of a panel of the Institute of Medicine, because of its important, well-\\n\\ndocumented health benefits for women and their families.\\n\\nAs the Guttmacher Institute has indicated previously, we believe the Departments have already gone\\n\\nwell beyond what is legally required by providing an exemption to this contraceptive coverage\\n\\nguarantee for houses of worship and an accommodation for other religiously affiliated nonprofit\\n\\norganizations, such as universities, hospitals and social relief agencies. Under that accommodation,\\n\\nemployees and their dependents are guaranteed seamless contraceptive coverage without out-of-\\n\\npocket costs, but that coverage must be provided by the organization\\xe2\\x80\\x99s insurance company or third-\\n\\nparty administrator. The organization itself does not have to \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccontract, arrange, pay or refer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for any\\n\\ncontraceptive coverage to which it objects on religious grounds.\\n\\nHowever, in its June 2014 decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, the U.S. Supreme Court held\\n\\nthat a subset of closely held for-profit corporations that assert a religious objection to some or all\\n\\nforms of contraception cannot be required to include such coverage in the health plans they sponsor\\n\\nfor employees and their families. The majority decision hinged on the availability of alternate ways\\n\\nof ensuring that employees and dependents are guaranteed contraceptive coverage, and specifically\\n\\nsuggested that the administration could expand the existing accommodation.\\n\\nThe Guttmacher Institute disagrees with the Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision, and supports efforts in Congress to\\n\\nensure that employees and their family members maintain access to contraceptive coverage and care,\\n\\nGuttmacher Institute    October 2014\\n\\nregardless of their employers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 religious objections. However, we agree that the Departments must\\n\\ntake whatever steps are possible to mitigate the potential harm of this decision, and the most obvious\\n\\npath is to follow the Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s suggestion, as these proposed rules would do. In doing so, the\\n\\nDepartments must maintain their focus on how to ensure that as few women as possible are left out\\n\\nof the contraceptive coverage guarantee or face discriminatory burdens in making use of their\\n\\ncoverage and accessing needed care.\\n\\nScope of the Accommodation\\n\\nIn the proposed rules, the Departments lay out a framework for how to determine which for-profit\\n\\nentities are eligible for an expanded accommodation. That framework first defines a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cqualifying\\n\\nclosely held for-profit entity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and then requires that the entity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s religious objection to contraceptive\\n\\ncoverage be established by specific corporate action in accordance with applicable state laws on\\n\\ncorporate governance.\\n\\nThe Guttmacher Institute urges the Departments to tailor these definitions and requirements as\\n\\nnarrowly as possible to match the intent of the Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision. As the Departments make clear in\\n\\nthe proposed rules, there is no single legal definition of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclosely held\\xe2\\x80\\x9d corporation. The Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\n\\nmajority did not tie its decision to any such definition, or to specific numerical thresholds. Rather, the\\n\\nCourt highlighted the facts that the specific companies in question were owned and controlled\\n\\nexclusively by the individual plaintiffs and that the owners were of a single mind in operating their\\n\\nbusiness in accordance with their religious beliefs.\\n\\nTherefore, the Departments should not rely merely on numerical thresholds regarding corporate\\n\\nownership in defining which for-profit entities qualify for the accommodation. Rather, that definition\\n\\nshould require the entity to be clearly and unanimously run in accordance with publicly expressed\\n\\nreligious principles. Moreover, the decision to assert a religious objection to contraceptive coverage\\n\\nshould be made as a separate, formal action in accordance with applicable corporate law, and\\n\\ndocumentation of that action should be reported to the Departments and/or the entity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s insurer or\\n\\nthird-party administrator, depending on the process the entity uses to assert its religious objection.\\n\\nThe Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s majority asserted that its decision would be narrow in its impact, and the Departments\\n\\nshould ensure that assertion becomes reality. That is crucial, because in practice, objections to\\n\\ncontraception are exceedingly rare: Indeed, 99% of sexually experienced U.S. women of\\n\\nreproductive age\\xe2\\x80\\x94including 99% of Catholic women and 99% of women affiliated with a Baptist or\\n\\nfundamentalist Protestant denomination\\xe2\\x80\\x94have used contraception at some point in their lives.\\n\\nTransparency and Enforcement\\n\\nThe Departments also request comments on other potential changes to the accommodation that might\\n\\nbe necessary, and on the likely number of entities who might make use of the accommodation and\\n\\nthe number of employees and dependents who would be affected.\\n\\nBeyond counting the entities that have brought lawsuits objecting to the contraceptive coverage\\n\\nguarantee, there is simply no reasonable way to make the types of estimates the Departments have\\n\\nrequested. This points to one important modification that the Departments should make to the\\n\\naccommodation: They should take necessary steps to improve transparency about which entities\\n\\nutilize the accommodation.\\n\\nGuttmacher Institute    October 2014\\n\\nSpecifically, we recommend that the Departments keep track of which entities have notified DHHS\\n\\ndirectly about their religious objections to covering some or all methods of contraception, in\\n\\naccordance with the alternate notice process established in the interim final rules that were also\\n\\npublished in the Federal Register on August 27, 2014 (CMS-9939-IFC).\\n\\nFurther, we recommend that the Departments require notice to DHHS under the original process\\n\\nestablished by the July 2013 regulations. Under that process, objecting entities provide notice of their\\n\\nobjections to their insurance company or third-party administrator. The Departments should require\\n\\ninsurance companies and third-party administrators to report to DHHS any such notices they have\\n\\nreceived. Such a requirement would pose no new obligations on the objecting entity itself.\\n\\nTogether, these two notice requirements would provide a comprehensive accounting of all entities\\n\\nthat have taken advantage of the accommodation. That would enable the Departments to provide\\n\\nappropriate oversight and enforcement to ensure that the accommodation is working as intended.\\n\\nIn addition, the Departments should make public its records about which entities have taken\\n\\nadvantage of the accommodation. That would provide important information to the current and\\n\\npotential employees of objecting employers. It would also enable lawmakers, the courts, the media\\n\\nand the public to gauge whether this arrangement is working as intended, among the nonprofit\\n\\norganizations currently taking advantage of it and any for-profit corporations that are given that\\n\\noption through this rulemaking.\\n\\nFinally, we repeat our call for the Departments to lay out other explicit processes to monitor, enforce\\n\\nand encourage compliance with the Sec. 2713 requirements overall, including the contraceptive\\n\\ncoverage requirement, as well as with the religious exemption and religious accommodation for\\n\\ncontraceptive coverage. Those processes should allow consumers to issue complaints and make\\n\\nappeals when insurers, providers or pharmacies do not adhere to the law and consumers are\\n\\ninappropriately denied access to or required to absorb some of the cost of protected services and\\n\\nsupplies. To encourage compliance, the Departments should provide technical assistance and\\n\\neducation to state agencies, health plans, health care providers, pharmacies and the general public.\\n\\nWe recommend that the Departments designate a central oversight and enforcement entity to handle\\n\\nthese responsibilities.\\n\\nWe hope you find these comments useful as you interpret and implement the preventive services\\n\\nprovision. If you need additional information about the issues raised in this letter, please feel free to\\n\\ncontact Adam Sonfield in the Institute\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Washington office. He may be reached either by phone at\\n\\n202-296-4012 or by email at asonfield@guttmacher.org.\\n\\nThank you for your consideration.\\n\\nSincerely yours,\\n\\nRachel Benson Gold\\n\\nActing Vice President for Public Policy\\n'"
