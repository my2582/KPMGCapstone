Economic,, actuarial, and administrative data prove otherwise. A February 2012 publication by the Office of the, Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) entitled The Cost of Covering Contraceptives, through Health Insurance found that the actual cost of adding contraceptives with no cost sharing to an, existing plan is between $21 and $41 annually per insured, as determined by three separate actuarial, companies. Adjusted for inflation, using 8% medical trend per year this equates to $26-$52 annually., In the SHIP arena with average policies of about $1600, this would be result in a 2-3.5 % increase in, rate.

Therefore, many who attend anti-contraceptive institutions may not wish to be or may, even be extremely offended by being automatically enrolled in an individual contraceptive-only, policy.

In the context of an insurance policy,, the benefits offered by the issuer in exchange for a premium paid by the insured are both adequate, consideration.

Therefore, many who attend anti-contraceptive institutions may not wish to be or may, even be extremely offended by being automatically enrolled in an individual contraceptive-only, policy. It will simply be a waste of resources for all parties involved if an issuer creates, determines, eligibility, and enrolls all students into an individual health policy, just for the student to immediately, cancel., Students attending religious institutions are aware of the religious doctrines the school has employed, as part of their daily lives. Just like the decision-making process to attend any school, students are, acutely aware ...  \n",
       "3    [III. It is impossible to completely insulate religious institutions of higher education from, partaking in providing contraceptive coverage to its students if the same SHIP it contracts, with for general student health must also provide contraceptive coverage via individual, policies., In the proposed rules, the Departments state, “the eligible organization would have no role in, contracting, arranging, paying, or referring for this separate contraceptive coverage” (Federal, Register, Vol. 79, No. 166, Pg. 51118). This is unattainable and unrealistic. Even if SHIP issuers, provide separate individual contraceptive-only coverage to students, religious institutions of higher, education must still be involved in the day-to-day administration of these policies and will be forced, to partake in providing this benefit against their will., In order for a SHIP issuer to offer contraceptive coverage on an individual basis, the institution, must first identify the individual students who wa...  \n",

Requiring SHIP issuers to provide free contraceptive coverage via individual policies is, contrary to basic contract law., An issued health insurance policy is a contract between an insurance company and the insured., Contracts are binding and enforceable only when one party extends an offer, the other party accepts, the offer, and adequate consideration is exchanged by both. In the context of an insurance policy,, the benefits offered by the issuer in exchange for a premium paid by the insured are both adequate, consideration. However, under the proposed rule, the “insured” is paying no premium, yet the, SHIP issuer must still provide health coverage under the guise of a legally-executed policy. As such,, neither party is contractually protected since this “agreement” is in direct conflict with general, contract law.]  \n",
       "5    [V. Request for clarity: The proposed rule seems to distinguish between the “full range of, FDA approved contraception as prescribed” and “certain contraception services”. Is there, more clarity regarding which methods of contraception must be excluded?, The proposed rule references methods of contraception in two seemly distinct ways. The first, reference is regarding the coverage requirement for non-eligible entities which is referenced, numerous times as “Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved contraception as prescribed by, a health care provider”. These references are made both directly and through reference to the, Health Resources and Services (HRSA) guidelines. A second and distinct reference to contraceptive, methods, specifically in connection with those methods to which the eligible entity may object is, repeatedly referred as “certain contraceptive services”. Nationwide requests clarity on these, references. Is there a method of contraception that is both required ...  \n",
       "6    [VI. Proposed solution: Utilize the Exchanges to provide free contraceptive coverage to, students attending religious institutions., Rather than require each individual SHIP carrier to provide free separate contraceptive-only, coverage for students of religious institutions, Nationwide proposes that this individual policy be, offered through the Exchange directly to these students. This would eliminate every one of the, issues discussed above in this comment letter. Not only would the Departments reduce their, administrative burden of auditing and overseeing each individual SHIP carrier, the religious entities, themselves can truly be separated from the process of providing contraceptive coverage. Students, will have the freedom and option to decide for themselves whether they wish to have contraceptive, coverage or not, and those who do can obtain it directly themselves through the Exchange by, applying and submitting the required documentation. Neither the school nor the SHIP car...  \n",
       "7                       [VII. Proposed solution: Give the covered student an above line reimbursement on their, federal income taxes for all costs incurred for non-covered contraception methods., As opposed to requiring the insurance company to craft individual insurance contracts for specific, methods of contraception, of which the eligible entity would still be an unwitting participant and, would potentially breach the privacy of the covered student. The Departments could allow the, covered persons to submit any expenditure for those services, excluded under their plan, along with, their federal tax return for a full refund. This would eliminate the requirement for insurers to craft, and administer a whole new policy as well as completely remove the eligible entity from any, involvement and thus protect the students’ privacy. The burden to the federal government would be, minimal as it would simply tack the requirement onto an existing function, for which there are, existing guidelines.]  \n",
       "8    [Conclusion, Nationwide respectfully proposes that SHIP issuers should not be required to automatically enroll, students attending anti-contraceptive religious institutions into a separate health plan purely for, certain contraceptive services. Not only is this contrary to basic contract law, it is a costly,, cumbersome burden to place upon insurance carriers, TPAs, and religious institutions. Nationwide, also asks that the Departments consider the above alternative options that would still provide these, students access to free contraceptives while reducing administration strain and truly preventing, religious institutions from having to partake in providing contraceptives.

       "11   [2. The Limited Exemption, The proposed rules do not alter the fact that the vast majority of individual, and institutional stakeholders with religious or moral objections to contraceptive, coverage are subject to the mandate.

       "14   [FOR-PROFIT CORPORATIONS -- THE DEFINITION OF CLOSELY HELD, As regards for-profit corporations, CFI reiterates its belief that Hobby Lobby was incorrectly, decided on multiple grounds. CFI maintains that RFRA was not intended to provide a right of, action for corporations, and that even so, Hobby Lobby's putative religious freedom exercise, rights were not substantially burdened by compliance with the contraception mandate., CFI recognizes, however, that the Departments are required to make a new rule in light of the, Supreme Court's majority opinion in Hobby Lobby. In order to do this, CFI recommends that the, Departments place front and center the overriding goal of the contraception mandate — the, provision of preventive care to women without co-pay — and write any exemption that allows for-, profit corporations to claim religious status as narrowly as is possible given the Supreme Court, ruling, ensuring that as many women as possible receive the full benefit of the rules of th...  \n",

What is the rationale behind the corporate form?, The idea of corporate personhood brings with it multiple benefits, not least in tax status, but also, the protection of the assets of investors from legal claim for the actions of the corporation. When, a business incorporates, it becomes a person under the law for various purposes — capable of, signing contracts, filing taxes, and suing or being sued in federal and state courts. This status, lo The IRS defines a closely held corporation as one which is not a personal services corporation, and which, \"[a]t, any time during the last half of the tax year, more than 50% of the value of its outstanding stock is, directly or, indirectly, owned by or for five or fewer individuals. \"Individual\" includes certain trusts and private foundations.\", IRS Publication 542, available at http://www.irs.gov/publications/p542/, ar02.html#en US 2011 aublink1000257747 (last visited October 15, 2014), places a barrier between the owners as individual...  \n",
       "16   [B. What is the purpose served by granting an exclusion?, Hobby Lobby held that \"a federal regulation's restriction on the activities of a for-profit closely, held corporation must comply with RFRA.\"I I It also found that requiring compliance with the, contraceptive mandate as written did not comply with RFRA. In writing an exemption for certain, closely held for-profit corporations to the requirements of the contraception mandate, the, Departments should keep in mind the Court's rationale in finding that the Hobby Lobby as a, corporation had its rights to free exercise of religion violated by compliance with this section of, the ACA. It is not that the corporate being itself has religious beliefs, e.g., a belief that providing, insurance coverage for contraception is a sinful act. These were the beliefs of the Green brothers,, the owners of the Hobby Lobby chain. The rationale for providing an exemption in this situation, is that, because of the closely held nature of the corporat...  \n",
       "17   [C. Exemptions will have impact beyond contraception., It is important to note at this juncture that the impact of any exemption written by the, Departments allowing closely held corporations to opt out of the provisions of the contraception, mandate will not be applicable solely to cases involving contraception. The newly found right for, for-profit corporations to sue under RFR.A that Justice Alito and four other justices created in the, Hobby Lobby decision is not restricted to matters of birth control alone. For, as Justice Ginsburg, noted in her dissent, there is no boundary to this right, and corporations covered by any, exemption will be free to sue under RFRA to exclude themselves from other requirements of the, ACA.

Day-to-day control, not simple ownership, is important., The exemption drawn by the Departments should therefore include only those closely held, corporations where the actions of the corporation can reasonably be imputed onto the owners., While it is certainly true that the overall size of the corporation, its revenue, and the number of, owners plays an important role here, as the more people a corporation employs, the larger its, revenue, and the more people who have decision-making authority through share ownership, the, 11 Hobby Lobby, 134 S.

However, a, more important distinction to be drawn is that based on the locus of control within the company., In order for an action of the corporation to be imputed to be an action of the owner, in the sense, of being a substantial burden on his or her right to religious freedom, that individual owner must, be reasonably seen as responsi...  \n",
       "19   [E. Examples of possible regulations., As noted above, the IRS defines closely held corporations by the number of shareholders,, requiring 50% of the stock to be held by five or fewer individuals. 14 State corporation laws also, have their own definitions of closely held corporations. In Delaware, for example, a close, corporation is defined as one where, amongst other requirements, \"[a]ll of the corporation's, issued stock of all classes, exclusive of treasury shares, shall be ... held of record by not more, than a specified number of persons, not exceeding 30.\" 1 ' CFI does not believe that following any, single definition for closely held corporation currently in use will adequately defend the purpose, of the contraception mandate, that is the provision of preventive services to women without co-, pay, while at the same time reflecting the intention of the Supreme Court in Hobby Lobby to, permit corporations an exemption where a reasonable observer would impute the actions of th...  \n",
       "20   [CONCLUSION, The Departments must craft rules regarding the contraceptive mandate that follow the law in, light of the Hobby Lobby decision, but which also protect the purpose behind the contraception, mandate.

Protections for religious conscience, including protections of for-profit, entities, have been a bipartisan tradition in the health care context for four, decades., For forty years, federal law has protected religious conscience in the, abortion context, in order to ensure that the “right to choose” includes citizens’, right to choose not to participate in, or fund, abortions.

This premise is mistaken. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act --, not another federal or state law, and certainly not a federal regulation – determines, whether a “person,” including a for-profit corporation, may invoke RFRA’s, protection against application of the HHS Mandate., As the Supreme Court reasoned in Hobby Lobby, “RFRA applies to ‘a, person's’ exercise of religion,’ 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb–1(a), (b), and RFRA itself, does not define the term ‘person.’ We therefore look to the Dictionary Act, which, we must consult ‘[i]n determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, unless t...  \n",

       "146  [Whether to apply the approach of the July 2013 version of the \"accommodation\" to for-, profit \"eli2ible manizations\", The Departments further seek comment (at p. 51122) on whether the current version of, the \"accommodation\" reflected in the July 2013 final regulations should be applied to for-profit, entities. It should not. As indicated above, and for the reasons discussed herein and by the, Catholic Bishops in their comment letters, the July 2013 self-certification process requires us to, (i) be complicit in an objectionable process resulting in immoral action or (ii) face penalties. The, Departments must either eliminate the mandate, or provide an accommodation for the exercise of, our faith that neither dictates how we exercise our religious beliefs nor forces us to violate them., Thank you for your attention to our comments on these very important matters. We, strongly urge the Departments to take a different course with the Proposed Rule and the mandate, overall that will af...  \n",
       "147  [RE: CMS-9940-P: Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act, Dear Ms. Tavenner:, On behalf of the American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM) I am pleased to submit these, comments in response to the proposed rule titled “Coverage of Certain Preventive Services, Under the Affordable Care Act,” published in the Federal Register, on August 27, 2014.1, ACNM is the national professional association representing Certified Nurse-Midwives (CNMs), and Certified Midwives (CMs), who collectively serve hundreds of thousands of women every, year. In addition to maternity care, CNMs and CMs provide a wide range of primary and well, women services throughout the lifecycle, including contraceptive care. Our members have a, significant interest in ensuring that women have appropriate access to all FDA approved, contraceptive methods and services. We express appreciation for the Administration’s, expeditious response to the Supreme Court’s recent Hobby Lobby decision. We ho...  \n",

We, believe that this mechanism, already in place for non-profit religious organizations, makes it, possible for women to receive the specified contraceptive items and services, while, simultaneously preserving the constitutional right to the free exercise of religion., 1 79 FR 51119, 8403 Colesville Road, Suite 1550, Silver Spring, MD 20910-6374 240.485.1800 fax: 240.485.1818 www.midwife.org]  \n",
       "149  [Defining a Closely Held For-Profit Entity, In the discussion under this heading, the Departments request comment on how to define a, closely held for-profit entity for purposes of the expanded exemption. In a specific request, the, Departments request comment on rationales for “the scope and operation of such, accommodations.” While ACNM does not have a position with regard to the specific number of, owners or the proportion of the company that must reside with a limited number of owners, we, do have concerns about how decisions related to those factors might play out after finalization of, this regulation., We anticipate that if closely held for-profit entities are defined very narrowly, so that only, entities with a very small set of owners are able to qualify for the exception, we are likely to see, further litigation brought by companies with numbers of owners that exceed the established limit., This may result in situations where it is unclear whether the exception applies du...  \n",

CHA is the national leadership, organization for the Catholic health ministry, consisting of more than 2,000 Catholic, health care sponsors, systems, hospitals, long-term care facilities, and related, organizations.

       "151  [RE: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the, Affordable Care Act., In a notice published in the Federal Register on August 27, 2014 (Vol. 79, No. 166, pp. 51118–, 51127), the Departments of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Labor, and the Treasury issued, proposed rules related to a section of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) that, requires group health plans and health insurance issuers in the group and individual markets to, provide benefits, without cost-sharing, for a series of preventive services, notably including, contraceptive services. On behalf of the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit organization dedicated to, advancing sexual and reproductive health worldwide through research, policy analysis and public, education, I am pleased to submit the following comments on the proposed rules., Under Sec. 2713 of the Public Health Service Act, as established by the ACA, individuals with, private health coverage (asid...  \n",
       "152  [Scope of the Accommodation, In the proposed rules, the Departments lay out a framework for how to determine which for-profit, entities are eligible for an expanded accommodation. That framework first defines a “qualifying, closely held for-profit entity” and then requires that the entity’s religious objection to contraceptive, coverage be established by specific corporate action in accordance with applicable state laws on, corporate governance., The Guttmacher Institute urges the Departments to tailor these definitions and requirements as, narrowly as possible to match the intent of the Court’s decision. As the Departments make clear in, the proposed rules, there is no single legal definition of a “closely held” corporation. The Court’s, majority did not tie its decision to any such definition, or to specific numerical thresholds. Rather, the, Court highlighted the facts that the specific companies in question were owned and controlled, exclusively by the individual plaintiffs and...  \n",
       "153  [Transparency and Enforcement, The Departments also request comments on other potential changes to the accommodation that might, be necessary, and on the likely number of entities who might make use of the accommodation and, the number of employees and dependents who would be affected., Beyond counting the entities that have brought lawsuits objecting to the contraceptive coverage, guarantee, there is simply no reasonable way to make the types of estimates the Departments have, requested. This points to one important modification that the Departments should make to the, accommodation: They should take necessary steps to improve transparency about which entities, utilize the accommodation., Guttmacher Institute, 2014-10-01 00:00:00, Specifically, we recommend that the Departments keep track of which entities have notified DHHS, directly about their religious objections to covering some or all methods of contraception, in, accordance with the alternate notice process established in t...  \n",

       "0  [Re: Nationwide Life Insurance Company’s comments on separate contraceptive-only policies for, students of religious institutions, To Whom It May Concern:, On behalf of Nationwide Life Insurance Company (“Nationwide”) and its affiliated companies, we, appreciate the opportunity to provide comments in response to CMS–9940–Pin which the Internal, Revenue Service (“IRS”), Employee Benefits Security Administration (“EBSA”), and the, Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) solicited comments on its proposed rule, concerning the coverage of certain preventive services under the Patient Protection and Affordable, Care Act (“ACA”). Nationwide currently has the fourth largest share of the student health, insurance plan (“SHIP”) market and insures over 130,000 undergraduate, graduate, and international, students at 183 colleges and universities throughout the U.S. We do not offer any other group or, individual major medical health policies in any market., The Departments asked for in...  \n",
       "1  [I. Providing contraceptive coverage in the student market is not cost neutral and imposes a, significant administrative burden upon all parties., The Department’s basic premise that “issuers generally would find that providing such contraceptive, coverage is cost neutral” is in error (Federal Register, Vol. 78, No. 25, Pg. 8463). Economic,, actuarial, and administrative data prove otherwise. A February 2012 publication by the Office of the, Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) entitled The Cost of Covering Contraceptives, through Health Insurance found that the actual cost of adding contraceptives with no cost sharing to an, existing plan is between $21 and $41 annually per insured, as determined by three separate actuarial, companies. Adjusted for inflation, using 8% medical trend per year this equates to $26-$52 annually., In the SHIP arena with average policies of about $1600, this would be result in a 2-3.5 % increase in, rate. It is important to note that th...  \n",
       "2  [II. Students enrolled in a religious institution of higher education may not wish to be, automatically enrolled in a contraceptive-only health plan., Students who choose to attend a religious institution of higher learning do so for a reason, and most, of the time, these students strongly believe and share in the religious convictions of their chosen, institution. Therefore, many who attend anti-contraceptive institutions may not wish to be or may, even be extremely offended by being automatically enrolled in an individual contraceptive-only, policy. It will simply be a waste of resources for all parties involved if an issuer creates, determines, eligibility, and enrolls all students into an individual health policy, just for the student to immediately, cancel., Students attending religious institutions are aware of the religious doctrines the school has employed, as part of their daily lives. Just like the decision-making process to attend any school, students are, acutely aware ...  "
